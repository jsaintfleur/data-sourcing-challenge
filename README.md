This project prepares a dataset to help NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center forecast Geomagnetic Storms (GSTs) caused by Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). Data is extracted from NASAâ€™s API, cleaned, merged, and the time difference between CME and GST events is calculated for future machine learning models.
