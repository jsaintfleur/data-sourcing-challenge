# Geomagnetic Storm Prediction Data Preparation

## Purpose

The **Geomagnetic Storm Prediction Data Preparation** project aims to prepare a dataset to assist the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center in predicting Geomagnetic Storms (GSTs). These storms, often triggered by Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) from the Sun, can disrupt critical infrastructure such as satellites, GPS systems, and power grids. By analyzing the time intervals between CME and GST events using data from NASA's DONKI API, this project provides a foundation for machine learning models to improve NOAA's forecasting accuracy.

Driven by my interest in applying data science to real-world challenges, I created this program to expand my knowledge in data extraction, transformation, and analysis. Through this project, I explored working with APIs, handling time-series data, and preparing datasets for future predictive modeling efforts. The experience allowed me to deepen my Python and data manipulation skills in a practical, impactful scenario.

## Overview

The **Geomagnetic Storm Prediction Data Preparation** project follows a structured process to extract, clean, merge, and analyze CME and GST data from NASA's DONKI API. This pipeline prepares a final dataset that captures key temporal relationships, enabling further analysis and predictive modeling. The project addresses essential questions for storm prediction, including:

- How long does it typically take for a CME event to lead to a GST?

## Key Steps

### Part 1: Request CME Data

1. **API Query**: Set up the base URL and parameters for NASA's DONKI API to fetch CME data over a specified date range.
   ```python
   base_url = "https://api.nasa.gov/DONKI/"
   specifier = "CME"
   startDate = "2013-05-01"
   endDate = "2024-05-01"

2. **Data Retrieval**: Fetch CME data, convert it to JSON, and load it into a DataFrame.

### Part 2: Request GST Data

1. **API Query**: Use the same base URL and parameters to extract GST data.
   ```python
   base_url = "https://api.nasa.gov/DONKI/"
   specifier = "GST"
   startDate = "2013-05-01"
   endDate = "2024-05-01"

2. **Data Retrieval**: Fetch GST data, convert it to JSON, and load it into a DataFrame.

3. **Data Cleaning**: Retain only necessary columns, and use `explode()` to separate rows with multiple linked events.

4. **Activity ID Extraction**: Extract CME-related `activityID` from linked events.


### Part 3: Merge and Clean Data

1. **Merge Datasets**: Merge the CME and GST DataFrames on their relevant `activityID` columns.

2. **Calculate Time Difference**: Compute the time difference (in minutes) between CME and GST occurrences, adding this as a new column (`timeDiff`).

3. **Summary Statistics**: Use `describe()` to review the average and median time differences between CME and GST events.

4. **Export Data**: Save the final dataset as `merged_cme_gst_data.csv` for future use in machine learning models.

This project serves as a foundation for future research, analysis, and machine learning applications that can enhance understanding and forecasting of geomagnetic storms (GSTs) triggered by Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs):

- **Forecast Improvement**: By utilizing this dataset, predictive models can be developed to forecast GST events based on CME characteristics and timing. This can allow NOAA to anticipate the onset of geomagnetic storms with higher accuracy. In particular, models trained on these patterns can help identify high-risk periods following CME events, providing a crucial window for early warnings and mitigating potential impacts on GPS, power grids, and satellites.

- **Pattern Analysis**: The dataset enables researchers to conduct in-depth analyses of time intervals between CME and GST events. By examining these intervals and other CME attributes, researchers can uncover patterns that determine the likelihood and severity of GSTs following specific CMEs. This analysis could lead to improved understanding of space weather conditions and contribute to new scientific findings that enhance space weather forecasting capabilities.

- **Resource Allocation**: Insights derived from this dataset can assist agencies like NASA and NOAA in optimizing their resource allocation. By identifying periods of heightened geomagnetic storm risk, decision-makers can better prioritize satellite monitoring, instrument calibration, and other key resources to maximize preparedness for potential space weather disruptions. This proactive resource planning based on predictive insights can be crucial in ensuring uninterrupted functionality of vital infrastructure during high-risk periods.

- **Event Correlation Analysis**: The time differences and correlations between CME characteristics and subsequent GSTs offer a valuable dataset for scientists studying solar-terrestrial interactions. Analyzing such correlations can contribute to understanding how solar activity affects Earthâ€™s magnetosphere, leading to better-informed models that can predict space weather impacts more accurately.

This data-driven, targeted monitoring approach will allow NOAA to allocate observational and computational resources more efficiently, focusing efforts on high-risk intervals and event types.

- **Develop Comprehensive Response Strategies**: Historical analysis of GST events enables agencies and infrastructure operators to implement preemptive protective measures during predicted high-risk periods. This proactive approach would allow satellite operators to adjust orbits, power grid operators to implement surge protection, and aviation to plan adaptive routing, minimizing potential disruptions from geomagnetic disturbances.

- **Enhance Early Warning Systems**: By integrating nuanced CME data insights into existing early warning systems, agencies can issue more precise, context-aware alerts. This tailored alerting strategy, based on specific CME attributes linked to GST onset, would enable critical sectors to prepare effectively, reducing response times and bolstering resilience across industries.

- **Foster Interagency Collaboration**: Given the cross-sector impacts of geomagnetic storms, collaboration between NOAA, NASA, and other key stakeholders is essential for a unified response. Developing shared standards for data interpretation and event prioritization will enable synchronized, coordinated efforts across sectors, reinforcing national resilience to space weather phenomena.

By implementing these recommendations, agencies can significantly improve predictive capabilities, preparedness, and response efficacy, ensuring that space weather events are managed with greater precision and foresight.
